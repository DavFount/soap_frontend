### Clan Chaox API
This API is for use within the ChaoX Discord and ChaoX Runner Utility (CRU). Though anyone is permitted to use the application, website, and discord the software used to create such applications are proprietary. All projects created by ChaoX are free to use however they are to be considered closed source.

The idea of this application is to expand upon the current game tracking and leader board system provided by Clan ChaoX.
